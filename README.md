# CLI Basics

## Basic Commands
Let's read about a couple of the most common commands that you're going to use.
`ls` = "list directory"; lists all files and folders in the present working directory (where you currently are).
`pwd` = "present working directory"; tells you where you currently are!
`cd foldername` = "change directory"; switches to the directory named 'foldername'. 'foldername' is always a child of the *pwd* (present working directory). 
`cd ..` =  changes directory to parent of *pwd*.
