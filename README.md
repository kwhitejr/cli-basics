# CLI Basics

## Basic Commands
Let's read about a couple of the most common commands that you're going to use.

`ls` = "list directory"; lists all files and folders in the present working directory (where you currently are).

`pwd` = "present working directory"; tells you where you currently are!

`cd foldername` = "change directory"; switches to the directory named 'foldername'. 'foldername' is always a child of the __pwd__ (present working directory). 

`cd ..` =  changes directory to parent of __pwd__. 

`cd ~` = changes directory to user's home directory. Very useful for resetting if you get lost!

`mkdir foldername` = "make directory"; creates a directory named 'foldername'. When you make directory this way, the new 'foldername' directory will be located inside of the __pwd__.

`touch filename.ext` = create a new file of name 'filename' and type '.ext'.
